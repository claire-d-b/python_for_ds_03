# C3 linearization is a way to figure out the order in which a program
# should look at classes to find a method or attribute
# when multiple inheritance is used. Here's a simple explanation:

# Purpose: When a class inherits from multiple other classes,
# C3 linearization helps to decide the order in which these
# parent classes are checked for methods or attributes.
# This order is called the Method Resolution Order (MRO).

# Rules:
#   - Local First: A class is checked before its parent classes.
#   - Inheritance Order: If one class inherits from another,
#   the parent class should come after the child class in the MRO.
#   - Respect Parent Order: The order of parents as defined in the class is
#   preserved.

# How It Works:
#   - Start with the class itself.
#   - Merge the MROs of the parent classes and the list of parents,
#   following the rules above.
#   - In the merge process, pick the first class from the lists that
#   doesnâ€™t appear later in any list
#   (this ensures no parent class is skipped or taken out of order).

# see ChatGPT simple explanation of C3 linearization to counter the pb
# of inheritance in diamand.
